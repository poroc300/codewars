    "# Equal Sides of an Array\n",

    "## Instructions\n",
    "You are going to be given an array of integers. Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum \n",
    "of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N. If there is no index that would \n",
    "make this happen, return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say you are given the array {1,2,3,4,3,2,1}:\n",
    "- Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array, the sum of left side of the index \n",
    "({1,2,3}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({3,2,1}) both equal 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at another one.\n",
    "You are given the array {1,100,50,-51,1,1}:\n",
    "- Your function will return the index 1, because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ({1}) and the sum of the right side of the index ({50,-51,1,1}) both equal 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last one:\n",
    "- You are given the array {20,10,-80,10,10,15,35}\n",
    "- At index 0 the left side is {}\n",
    "- The right side is {10,-80,10,10,15,35}\n",
    "- They both are equal to 0 when added. (Empty arrays are equal to 0 in this problem)\n",
    "- Index 0 is the place where the left side and right side are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Please remember that in most programming/scripting languages the index of an array starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input:  \n",
    "n integer array of length 0 < arr < 1000. The numbers in the array can be any integer positive or negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:  \n",
    "The lowest index N where the side to the left of N is equal to the side to the right of N. If you do not find an index that fits these rules, then you will return -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: \n",
    "If you are given an array with multiple answers, return the lowest correct index."
