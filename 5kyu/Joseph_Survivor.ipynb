    "In this kata you have to correctly return who is the \"survivor\", ie: the last element of a Josephus permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically you have to assume that n people are put into a circle and that they are eliminated in steps of k elements, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "josephus_survivor(7,3) => means 7 people in a circle;  \n",
    "one every 3 is eliminated until one remains  \n",
    "[1,2,3,4,5,6,7] - initial sequence  \n",
    "[1,2,4,5,6,7] => 3 is counted out  \n",
    "[1,2,4,5,7] => 6 is counted out  \n",
    "[1,4,5,7] => 2 is counted out  \n",
    "[1,4,5] => 7 is counted out  \n",
    "[1,4] => 5 is counted out  \n",
    "[4] => 1 counted out, 4 is the last element - the survivor!  \n",
    "\n",
    "The above link about the \"base\" kata description will give you a more thorough insight about the origin of this kind of permutation, but basically that's all that there is to know to solve this kata.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes and tips: using the solution to the other kata to check your function may be helpful, but as much larger numbers \n",
    "will be used, using an array/list to compute the number of the survivor may be too slow; you may assume that both n \n",
    "and k will always be >=1."
